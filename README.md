Human Posture Detection Using MediaPipe:
This application uses the MediaPipe library to analyze human posture in real-time using a webcam feed. It aims to detect poor posture and can potentially alert users to correct their posture accordingly.

Prerequisites:
Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV-Python
- MediaPipe

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe

Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-repository-directory
   

2. Run the application:
   To start the posture detection, execute:
   python posture_detection.py

Features
- Real-time posture detection: Utilizes webcam data to analyze and display the posture dynamically.
- Angle calculations: Calculates angles to determine the correctness of the posture.
- Visual feedback: Provides visual feedback through the webcam feed by highlighting the body parts and displaying the calculated angles.

Usage
After running the script, position yourself in front of the webcam. Try to maintain a side profile to the camera to get accurate posture analysis. The application will display the webcam feed with visual overlays indicating the posture angles.
